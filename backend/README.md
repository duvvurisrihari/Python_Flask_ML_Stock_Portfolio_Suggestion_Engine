# Python Backend (Using Flask)

## Flask is used for writing REST API's in python just like express and Node in JS

## <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-build-a-rest-api-using-flask/>

## https://iexcloud.io/ is being used to get the current stock data.(API_KEY is used to retrieve data)

### Python3 packages necessary

sudo pip3 install flask-restful

sudo pip3 install -U flask-cors

sudo pip3 install -U python-dotenv                <https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/>

sudo pip3 install -U requests

Note: Python3 is a pre-req for this to run in any system. Check if pip3 is also there.

--------------------------- .env should be there that should contain API KEY from iexcould site.
